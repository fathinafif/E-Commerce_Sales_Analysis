# E-Commerce Sales Analysis! üõçÔ∏èüìà

In this project, I have utilized my technical skills in SQL, Big Query, and Tableau that I learned through the Revou Mini Course to analyze the data. The dataset used for this project is from Google Data Cloud.

E-commerce is a vast and ever-changing field, and analyzing big data can help businesses to identify trends and patterns to improve their performance, campaigns, and decision-making processes.

In this project, I have used SQL to retrieve specific data from the dataset, such as category, name, department, product_id, order_id, and created_at. I have joined the bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products and bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items tables to get a better understanding of the sales patterns.

By sharing this project, I hope to provide insights into the e-commerce industry and inspire others to leverage their technical skills to analyze big data. Feel free to explore the code and data visualization on Tableau.
